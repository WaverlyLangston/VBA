This vba code exists behind a button in an excel file.

The user inputs contact information for leads in one of a number of target industries (see sheet 1 png for format).

The organization had leads for each of these industries.

Each contact inputed is sent an email from the appropiate lead's account and stylized to the lead's preferences.

Outreach is recorded so that equally customized follow up emails are sent according to the lead's preferences (sheet 2 png for format).

Email formatting is handled by a combination of VBA and html code (sheet 3).

Emails seem bespoke in intended contacts inbox and replies go directly to the lead without them having to send multiple waves of emails to many contacts.
